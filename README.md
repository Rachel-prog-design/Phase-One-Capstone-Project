This is my Book Explorer web app, built as my first capstone project at SheCanCode. It allows users to browse books, search by title, and add their favorite books to a favorites page. The app is fully responsive using html, Tailwind CSS and interactive with JavaScript. It fetches real book data from the Open Library API, stores favorites in localStorage, and updates dynamically on the page. The project demonstrates modern web development skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript modules, async API calls, and DOM manipulation.
